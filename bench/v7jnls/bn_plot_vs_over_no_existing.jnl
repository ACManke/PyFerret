! bn_plot_vs_over_no_existing.jnl
! Test alone and also within bn766_bug_fixes, where it
! finds the case of trying to overlay in x,y after
! drawing a z-t plot
! The update is to address issue number 90

set mode ignore_error

! The plot should generate an error about /vs/over
! when there is no underlying plot, or different directions.

let/units=degrees_east  xs = {40, 130,110}
let/units=degrees_north ys = {-20, 25, -10}
plot/vs/over  xs, ys

! the point of the fix is that we SHOULD see an error message
show symbol fer_last+error

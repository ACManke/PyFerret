! ACM 4/2005 ! set mode meta to save this plot for the metafile checks.
!            and ! cancel mode logo, so that .plt files are comparable.
! ACM 1/2007 Change from a bunch of plot items in a viewport, to separate
!            plots; for better checking of batch mode
!  2/18 *acm* keep mode logo turned off 
! 11/19 *acm* Save plots as gifs/pngs to make comparisons with all these examples
!  8/23 *acm* add a bit of testing for PyFerret system fonts and multi-line labels
!             See issue 138

 <NL> Ferret is an interactive computer visualization and analysis<NL>\
environment designed to meet the needs of oceanographers and<NL>\
meteorologists analyzing large and complex gridded data sets. It<NL>\
runs on most Unix systems, and on Windows NT/9x using X<NL>\
windows for display. It can be installed to run from a Web<NL>\
browser (WebFerret) for use while away from your desk or<NL>\
from a system lacking X windows software. It can transparently<NL>\
access extensive remote Internet data bases using OPeNDAP,<NL>\
formerly known as DODS. See the dods webpage\
<NL> <NL>\
Ferret was developed by the Thermal Modeling and Analysis<NL>\
Project (TMAP) at PMEL in Seattle to analyze the outputs of its<NL>\
numerical ocean models and compare them with gridded,<NL>\
observational data. The model data sets are generally multi-<NL>\
gigabyte in size with mixed 3 and 4-dimensional variables defined<NL>\
on staggered grids. Ferret offers a Mathematica-like approach to<NL>\
analysis, new variables may be defined interactively as<NL>\
mathematical expressions involving data set variables.<NL>\
Calculations may be applied over arbitrarily shaped regions. Fully<NL>\
documented graphics are produced with a single command.\
<NL> <NL>\
Many excellent software packages have been developed recently<NL>\
for @p2scientific visualization@p1. The features that make Ferret distinctive<NL>\
among these packages are Mathematica-like flexibility,<NL>\
geophysical formatting, intelligent connection to its data base,<NL>\
memory management for very large calculations, and symmetrical<NL>\
processing in 4 dimensions."
